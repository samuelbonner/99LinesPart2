# 99 Lines of Code

## This is a JavaScript exercise to iterate the '99 lines of code' "song" (although in this case, lyrics?).

This lab consists of 2 parts.

**First Part:**
- In this iteration I will be doing most of the logic/coding
- I will also get started on the graphical appearance
- The code will display the results in the developer console
    - (The HTML is just a test placeholder for part 2 of this lab)
