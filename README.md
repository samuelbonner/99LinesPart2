# 99 Lines of Code

## This is a JavaScript exercise to iterate the '99 lines of code' "song" (although in this case, lyrics?).

This lab consists of 2 parts.

**Second Part:**
- A button (& header) now exist on page load.
- Clicking the button creates a <div>, <h3>, and numerous <p> tags (one of each song line)
    - Each div is assigned a class name & color coded for that class.
